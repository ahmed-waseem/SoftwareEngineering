Functional Requirements:
1. The System Shall take one or multiple files from the user as input
  1.1. If a single file is given it should be a c/c++ file .
  1.2. If multiple files are given they should be compressed as a tarball and this single tarball should be uploaded.
  1.3. The given file should be executable using gcc and appropriate make file must be provided.

2. The System shall profile the files given as input and generate appropriate statistics.
  2.1. It should identify the bottlenecks and rank the functions.

3. The given file should run irrespective of any architecture.
  3.1. The given file should run sequentially.

4. The system should provide an option for manual or automatic injection of parallel statements.
  4.1. The parallel statements could be in Cuda, OpenMP and MPI (could be all three).

5. The system should parallelize in all three parallel platforms and displays which is appropriate.

6. The user must be provided an option of choosing the number of cores required for execution.

7. The system shall have an interactive GUI.
  7.1. The system shall perform required operation in fewer clicks.
  7.2. The GUI shall be simple to use and should be understood by people of other domains.

8. The generated files shall be neatly formatted and with appropriate comments.

9. The System Shall be independent of Operating System.

10. The Converted File should be easily downloadable.
  10.1. If the generated file is single 
  10.2. If there are multiple files convert it to tarball.

11.  The System shall parallelize and give its Output in the Specified time.

12. The System shall provide account for usage.
  12.1.  To store files for further Usage.

13.  The Output file must be faster than the serial code.

14. The System shall display the file size and other information after parallelizing.

15. The System shall have the ability to use different algorithms.

Non Functional Requirements

1. The System shall be developed using an object oriented design and development process.

2. The Development process model shall follow an incremental/evolutionary approach.

3. The system shall be maintainable.
