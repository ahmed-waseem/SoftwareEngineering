# Project Directory

There is a copy of the "Project Plan" document placed in the group folder. 

You may choose to see what other's are doing and this is encouraged.  But please 
edit ONLY your group's file. Try to incrementally add what you know and what
you currently can in the file. You may leave what you don't understand at this
stage. Everytime you make changes commit the file with appropriate, clear and 
understandable commit messages.

Enjoy your first experience as a Software Engineer!!!
